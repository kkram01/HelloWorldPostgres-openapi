# Connecting to Cloud SQL postgresql

The service account provided, only has access to connect to public schema, you will need to [Grant](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-grant.html) it access to the databases and tables it needs access to by obtaining the default user credentials. You can reset the password by following [this document](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/create-manage-users#change-pwd)

## Managing Connections

Please read the [following guidance on how to manage your connections](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/manage-connections#python), please note that mishandling connections will cause degregation in performance.


## Connect to Cloud SQL from on Premesis

From on-prem you will connect to the [public endpoint](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances), so a [firewall rule](https://hcaservicecentral.service-now.com/hca?id=hca_cat_item&sys_id=bc9146dedb79970006c1ef92ca96196e) is required to connect. If you are using the [cloud SQL auth proxy](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/connect-auth-proxy), the outbound port is `3307` instead of `5432`.

# Accessing Auto Generated Open API Spec through an Endpoint

The open API spec file is auto generated by the APIFlask library. It can be accessed on the path "/openapi.json" by default if no spec_path is defined when instantiating the APIflask object. For reference on configuration and different formats for the open API spec file, please refer to the [API Flask Documentation](https://apiflask.com/openapi/)

The Open API Swagger UI can be accessed on the path "/openapi"


# Locally Generating open API spec file

You can also generate the open api spec file for the code locally using the 'flask spec' command. Run `flask spec --output openapi.json`
please refer to the [Flask Spec Documentation](https://apiflask.com/openapi/#the-flask-spec-command) for more details.
